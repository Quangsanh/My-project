    <h1> This is <i> still</i> a motherfucking website.</h1>
    <p> And it's more fucking ferfect than the last guy's.</p>
    <h2> Seriously, it takes minimal fucking effort to improve this <br>shit.</h2>
    <h3>7 fucking declarations:</h3>
    <p>
        That's how much CSS it took to turn that  <a href="http://webcoban.vn">grotesque pile of shit</a>
         into this easy-to-read <br>
          masterpiece.It's so fucking simple and <i>still</i> has all the glory of the original perfect-ass <br> website:
       
        
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Shit's <i>still</i> lightweight and loads fast</li>
        <li><i>Still</i> fits on all your shitty screens</li>
        <li><i>Still</i> looks the same in all your shitty browsers</li>
        <li>The motherfucker's <i>still</i> accessible to every asshole that visits your site</li>
        <li>Shit's <i>still</i> legible and gets your fucking point across</li>
    </ul>
    <h3> And guess what, motherfucker:</h3>
    <p>You never knew it, but it's easy to improve readability on your site. Here's how.</p>
    <h2>Let it breathe</h2>
    <p>Look at lines 1 and 2 of some shitty website you're building. Assuming they're not
        <br> married they probably shouldn't be humping. The defaults are trash--pick a minimum<br>
         line-height: 1.4 for body copy. Headings should be tighter. If you can't see<br> 
         that...piss off.</p>
    <p> If you text hits the side of the browser, fuck off forever. You ever see a book like that?<br>
    Yes?What a shitty book.</p>
    <h2>A little less contrast</h2>
    <p> Black on while? How often do you see that kind of contrast in real life? Tone it down a<br>
    bit,asshole. I woukd've even made this site's background a nice <b>#EEEEEE</b> if I wasn't so <br>
    focused on keeping declaration to a lean 8 fucking lines</p>
<h2> Size Matters</h2>
<p> I know your partner says otherwise,but it's true. Bump the body copy to render close to<br>
16px or more. Smaller type words well for print,not the screen.</p>
<h2>Line-width,motherfucker</h2>
<p>Looking at an LCD screem is strainful enough. Don't make me read a line of text that's<br>
200 fucking characters long. Keep it to a nice 60-80 and users might actually read more<br>
than one sentence of your worthless dribble.</p>
<h3>Yes,this is <i>also</i> fucking satire,you fuck</h3>
<p>I love the creator of <a href="https://www.facebook.com/">this site's inspiration</a> did. What I'm saying is that it's so,so<br>
simple to make sites easier ti read. Websites are broken by default,they are functional,<br>
high-performing,and accesible,but they're also fucking ugly. You anf all the other web<br>
designers out thre need to make them not total shit.
